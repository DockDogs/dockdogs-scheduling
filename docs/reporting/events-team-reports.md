    __**IF A TEAM MEMBER IS SCHEDULED FOR A POSITION THAT IS NOT LISTED IN THE SPREADSHEET REFERENCED ABOVE THIS WILL NOT APPEAR ON THEIR SCHEDULE WITHOUT FIRST CONTACTING BRIAN KING TO MODIFY THE REPORT.**__

### Confirmed Versus Tentative Status

Only events with the **_GREEN_** or **_YELLOW_** status fields selected in the **_POSTED_** column will be included in these reports. This ensures that sponsors are only notified of events that have been **_POSTED_** on the [DockDogs](http://dockdogs.com) website and opened for registration.
