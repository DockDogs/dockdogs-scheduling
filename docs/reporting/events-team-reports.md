# NEEDS UPDATING! 

## Introduction

Members of the Events Team will receive their schedules via email on a pre-defined scheduled basis. These can arrive as a PDF or Excel document.

### Types of Reports

A report must be created new or duplicated from an existing report of a matching type for each new events team member. **_If a person is BOTH a DRIVER _and/or_ an EVENT MANAGER then this must be specified as such when creating the report._**

### Confirmed Versus Tentative Status

Only events with the **_GREEN_** or **_YELLOW_** status fields selected in the **_POSTED_** column will be included in these reports. This ensures that sponsors are only notified of events that have been **_POSTED_** on the [DockDogs](http://dockdogs.com) website and opened for registration.
