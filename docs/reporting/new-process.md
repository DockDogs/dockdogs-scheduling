# Scheduling A Person For An Event

* When scheduling a person for any of the positions **YOU MUST** select their name from the drop-down list of the appropriate category/column (ie: Driver).
* Each positions column (Driver, Admin, Event Manager, Announcer, Judge, Training) has been populated with the **full list** of current events team members. _This list is available via Google Drive in the following path: DOCKDOGS --> 2016 --> DD USA --> STAFFING --> "16 DockDogs - Smartsheet List of People"_. You can also access it via [clicking here](https://docs.google.com/a/dockdogs.com/document/d/1T7FNu4F9FGj924_7GzPigp0_XY6ms77Bm_uRYIyvmnw/edit?usp=sharing).


## What You Absolutely Must Not Do

!!! tip "IMPORTANT - THE MOST IMPORTANT THING EVER!"
    __**IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOU ABSOLUTELY NEVER SIMPLY TYPE A PERSONS NAME INTO ANY OF THE POSITIONS ROWS, ALWAYS USE THE DROPDOWN MENU TO SELECT SOMEONE**_

* In the event of a situation where you need to have notes about how there are special circumstances such as _Vince is driving to the event site and working only setup and Friday and then Sean will work Saturday and Sunday_ please use the **NOTES** function in Smartsheet to include these specifics. This is to ensure no modifications are entered into the columns for assigning schedules.
* The same holds true for when someone is training, simply enter their name via the dropdown menu for the TRAINING column, enter whatever details about their position such as **Amanda Gill will be training as ADMIN at FOUR COURNERS PET EXPO** using the **NOTES** feature in Smartsheet for this events row.


### Adding a New Person to DockDogs Events Team

* When **BRIAN SHARENOW** adds a new person to the events team and notifies **BRIAN KING** to create their Smartsheet schedule, **BRIAN KING** will add this persons name to each position's _(Driver, Judge, Wrangler, Announcer, Event Manager, Admin, Training)_ dropdown selections.
* Brian King will then log their schedule URL in the Google Sheet.
