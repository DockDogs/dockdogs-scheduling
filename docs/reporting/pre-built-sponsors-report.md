# Introduction

There are 3 pre-built sponsors reports available already configured inside of Smartsheet. These have pre-defined schedules assigned to them which will send an email to each sponsor on a weekly basis. An example report can be found [below](pre-built-sponsors-report.md#example-sponsorship-reports). 

### Selecting A Sponsor

In order to have an event show in the **_SPONSORSHIP REPORTS_** you need to designate which sponsor will have their dock at the event. This can be done by using the **_SPONSOR_** column inside of Smartsheet. 

### Confirmed Versus Tentative Status

Only events with the **_GREEN_** or **_YELLOW_** status fields selected in the **_POSTED_** column will be included in these reports. This ensures that sponsors are only notified of events that have been **_POSTED_** on the [DockDogs](http://dockdogs.com) website and opened for registration.
