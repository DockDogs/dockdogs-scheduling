* Why is the row showing **RED** text?
	* This is to identify events that are on **HOLD** status.  

* How can I view the prior contents of a given cell?
	* **Right click** on the cell in question and click **"View History"**

* What are the **BROWN** rows that are blank?
	* Brian Sharenow has put these in to separate weeks.

* What if an event has multiple docks/pools going to it?
	* Use the **INDENT ROW** function to add a secondary row and identify all the details here. _When filling in the subsequent (2nd, 3rd, 4th, docks simply designate which sponsor (if applicable), the events team members, the truck/trailer, etc._
